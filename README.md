Employ different techniques to train and evaluate ML models.


create your training and target variables by completing the following steps:

Create the training variables by converting the string values into numerical ones using the get_dummies() method.
Create the target variables.
Check the balance of the target variables.

Next, begin resampling the training data.
For each resampling algorithm, do the following:

Use the LogisticRegression classifier to make predictions and evaluate the modelâ€™s performance.
Calculate the accuracy score of the model.
Generate a confusion matrix.
Print out the imbalanced classification report.

For all three algorithms, the following have been completed:
An accuracy score for the model is calculated (7.5 pt)
A confusion matrix has been generated (7.5 pt)
An imbalanced classification report has been generated (15 pt)
